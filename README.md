# FÃ„RDSTOL

A fun little project to motorize your leftover and unwanted IKEA furniture.

This project consists of three parts:

1. Some firmware, based on the amazing [hoverboard-firmware-hack](https://github.com/NiklasFauth/hoverboard-firmware-hack).
2. An underframe, made either by hand or with a router. (TODO)
3. Some basic control circuitry.
